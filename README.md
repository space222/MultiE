MultiE is a multi-system emulator that serves as a framework for my emulation experiments.
I do my development on Linux (Ubuntu), but hope to support at least Windows in the future.

Classification of main-line system vs systems in alpha or beta is largely my whim, but systems 
out of beta generally have more than one usable/playable piece of software/game (not necessarily bug free). 
Systems in beta generally boot and get to the point of displaying gameplay (eg Intellivision or Atari 5200). Some 
systems are in beta largely because of a particular bug I want to fix before it comes out of beta
(eg MSX), or probably could but I just don't consider it done "enough" yet (Apple II). Systems in 
alpha need serious work as in don't boot or just started. The alpha&beta menus are not in any order
other than the top of alpha tends to be the newest system.

See todo.txt for the full status information. Systems that I've declared out of beta include:
* Nintendo: NES, GB/C, GBA, Virtual Boy, N64
* Sony: PS1
* Atari: 2600
* Sega: SMS, Genesis
* Colecovision

## Building

SDL2 required on all platforms.

### Linux

Linux builds need Zenity installed for the open file dialog.
Builds with CMake.

### Windows

Eventually
